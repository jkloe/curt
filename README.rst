**DEâ«¶TR**: End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers
========
PyTorch training code and pretrained models for **DETR** (**DE**tection **TR**ansformer).
We replace the full complex hand-crafted object detection pipeline with a Transformer, and match Faster R-CNN with a ResNet-50, obtaining **42 AP** on COCO using half the computation power (FLOPs) and the same number of parameters. Inference in 50 lines of PyTorch.

**What it is**. Unlike traditional computer vision techniques, DETR approaches object detection as a direct set prediction problem. It consists of a set-based global loss, which forces unique predictions via bipartite matching, and a Transformer encoder-decoder architecture. 
Given a fixed small set of learned object queries, DETR reasons about the relations of the objects and the global image context to directly output the final set of predictions in parallel. Due to this parallel nature, DETR is very fast and efficient.

**About the code**. We believe that object detection should not be more difficult than classification,
and should not require complex libraries for training and inference.
DETR is very simple to implement and experiment with, and we provide a
[standalone Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/detr/blob/colab/notebooks/detr_demo.ipynb)
showing how to do inference with DETR in only a few lines of PyTorch code.
Training code follows this idea - it is not a library,
but simply a [main.py](main.py) importing model and criterion
definitions with standard training loops.

Additionnally, we provide a Detectron2 wrapper in the d2/ folder. See the readme there for more information.
