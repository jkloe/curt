**Curt**: Layout Analysis with Transformers
===========================================

Curt is an experimental layout analysis system based on transformers. It uses
the set prediction approach of DETR to directly predict baselines encoded as
BÃ©zier curves and line classes. There is also an additional instance
segmentation head that predicts line bounding polygons.

Installation
------------

::

        $ pip install .


Training
--------

To train on ALTO or Page XML files on a GPU:

::

        $ curt train -d cuda train *.xml

**Warning**: Curt is resource-intensive and needs at least 30Gb of GPU memory
to train.

To train the instance segmentation head from an existing curve prediction
model: 

::

        $ curt polytrain -d cuda -i checkpoint.pth *.xml


Inference
---------

To be implemented.
